### 문제 설명

<p>A positive integer N is a base-b palindrome if the base-b representation of N is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same way in either direction. For instance, 7 (base 10) is a palindrome in any base greater than or equal to 8. It is also a palindrome in base 2 (111) and 6 (11), but not in 3 (21), 4 (13), 5 (12), or 7 (10). The first four base 2 palindromes (written in base 10) are 1, 3, 5, and 7.</p>

<p>You are supposed to find the M-th base-2 palindrome and output its base 10 representation.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input is a single line with a single positive integer M ≤ 50 000 in base 10.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output for input M should be a single line with the base 10 representation of the M-th base-2 palindrome.</p>
